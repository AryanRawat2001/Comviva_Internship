## Abstract

During my 4month internship with Comviva (4th September 2023 to 3rd Jan 2024) , I focused on learning and working with Azure's Generative AI services. This involved gaining a deep understanding of Azure's AI capabilities and exploring how to leverage its Generative AI services for various usecases. Throughout the internship, I focused on getting deep into Azure's Generative AI, honing my skills in utilizing these services to create innovative and impactful solutions. This experience provided valuable insights into the potential of Generative AI and its practical applications within the context of Azure. This abstract provides a glimpse into the comprehensive exploration and learning journey undertaken during the internship.

## Goal

The primary goal of the internship with Comviva was to gain proficiency in utilizing Azure's Generative AI services. This involved acquiring in-depth knowledge of the capabilities offered by Azure's Generative AI and understanding how these services can be effectively applied to real-world scenarios. The aim was to develop a strong foundation in leveraging Generative AI within the Azure ecosystem, with a focus on exploring its potential for driving innovation and solving complex challenges. The goal was to emerge from the internship with a comprehensive understanding of Azure's Generative AI services and their practical implications.

## Results

During the internship, I emphasized on doing a lot of Research on Generative AI services which Azure offers . Enhancements were made to the experience of offer delivery to end customers. This was achieved through the development of a text-to-audio model, with the objective of increasing the rate of offer acceptance. Additionally, a Spanish audio-to-text translation service was created, incorporating sentiment analysis to facilitate a deeper understanding of client calls.
